This document shall describe the technical specification of the Basic Logger module.

\subsection*{Design Goal}

The design goal of this module is it to deliver a simple none multithreaded logger interface which is easy to use and supports formatting.

\subsection*{The Interface}

The logger A\+PI shall cover 3 different approaches\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item free functions
\item a {\ttfamily Logger} class
\item Logger Macros
\end{DoxyItemize}

Each of those approaches shall have the same set of functions.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Log(format,\mbox{[}information\mbox{]})}
\item {\ttfamily Info(format,\mbox{[}information\mbox{]})}
\item {\ttfamily Debug(format,\mbox{[}information\mbox{]})}
\item {\ttfamily Warn(format,\mbox{[}information\mbox{]})}
\item {\ttfamily Error(format,\mbox{[}information\mbox{]})}
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries Activation specification}

The Module only works if one of the following pre-\/processor defines is defined\+:

{\ttfamily D\+E\+B\+UG , D\+E\+B\+U\+G\+\_\+ , \+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+U\+G\+\_\+ , D\+E\+B\+U\+G\+\_\+ , \+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+UG, C\+O\+F\+\_\+\+U\+S\+E\+\_\+\+L\+O\+G\+G\+ER}

if they are not defined the Logging class will be empty. {\ttfamily size 1} and the free function will be empty as well. No zero overhead.

{\bfseries Macro specification}

They shall be capitalized and always print the {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+\+F\+I\+L\+E\+\_\+\+\_\+} and {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+\+L\+I\+N\+E\+\_\+\+\_\+} with its output unless {\ttfamily C\+O\+F\+\_\+\+L\+O\+G\+G\+E\+R\+\_\+\+U\+S\+E\+\_\+\+D\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+L\+I\+NE} is not defined. If {\ttfamily C\+O\+F\+\_\+\+L\+O\+G\+G\+E\+R\+\_\+\+U\+S\+E\+\_\+\+D\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+L\+I\+NE} is undefined there shall be no output of the current line and file.

{\bfseries Output specification}

The output on the screen shall be as following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
[Level] [Date Time] [[File] [Line]] [Message]
\end{DoxyCode}


example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
[Info] [21-02-2018 22:03] </home/user/cpp/test.cpp:24> User data was empty used default.
\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries Sink Specification}

A {\ttfamily Sink} is a class which provides the low level function such as {\ttfamily print} on screen or save the output in a file. In this basic approach the {\ttfamily Sink} {\itshape cannot} be changes during runtime after its set.

The basic sinks the system shall support are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Standard in / out (Terminal)
\item File
\item Both 
\end{DoxyItemize}
